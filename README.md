# PredicitingEngagement
Predict the Engagement of tweets using social and tweet features.
# How it works
The twitter_data_test.csv is data gathered from the Tweepy library using the Twitter API. The data is then preprocessed in Data_Preprocessing.py and written out to an output.csv.
Then the regression models are run in the Prediction.py file. As well as some feature importance checking.
# How to run.
To run the project, change the file paths of the input file and output files. Ensure that the correct libraries are installed on the system based on the imports used.
